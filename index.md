### Selected topics

  * Exploration, visualization, and quality assessment of high dimensional genomics data
  * Large scale statistical inference
  * Analysis of microarray, RNASeq, and epigenetics data
  * Principal component analysis (PCA)
  * Cluster analysis
  * Cross validation
  * Model selection for classification and linear regression models
  * Gene function and gene set analysis
  * Resampling and the bootstrap
