### Update on lecture 14

We have updated lecture 14 to the one Dr. Jones was using in the class. Cheers :)

### Software Carpentry Workshop and other resources 

As you all know, this class involves heavy usage of R, Git, and Unix Shell, and some people in the class are new to those tools. Many people have also expressed interest in becoming better at scientific computing. So some of you might be interested in these opportunities: 

**[1. Software carpentry workshop](http://lmguzman.github.io/2016-01-29-UBC/)** 

There's a software carpentry workshop coming up, from Jan 29-30, 9am - 4:30pm. The focus will be on R, Unix Shell, and version control with Git. The workshop is open to everyone with any skill levels or disciplines!

**[2. R study Group](http://minisciencegirl.github.io/studyGroup/)** 

This is the group that is organizing the software carpentry workshop. If you can't make it to the workshop, you can also join them to keep practicing R, Python and other coding and open science tools at their weekly meet-ups. 

**[3. Coursera on Statistical Inference](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inference/)** 

There's a Coursera course that just started. It's a free online course on statistics, and it covers some of the topics covered in this class. If you need a refresher on some concepts in statistics, or reenforcement on what's covered in the class, or simply need some hand-on tutorials on using R to apply those concepts, definitely check it out!
