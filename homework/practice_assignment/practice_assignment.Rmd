Welcome to STAT540! First thing first, we need to get you a personal repository where you will record all your work and learning. Please complete [this survey](https://goo.gl/forms/NzMRW87Ccmfmc6x13) and we will set up your repository as soon as possible. Note that you must have this set up before you can proceed with any assignments because GitHub is where you will submit your work and receive feedback and grades. 

The point of this assignment is to get you warm up with git, GitHub, markdown, and R so you're more prepared for the future assignments. The first few seminars will cover all you need to know for completing this practice assignment. 

Note that this practice assignment, just like your 30pt assignment, will need to be done in Rmarkdown (.Rmd) because it requires R code. 

## 1. Create a README in your repo (1pt)

Once you have joined the organization through the email invite and have a repository set up (in the format of zz_lastname_firstname), you can start personalizing it by creating a README.md file. This would help people who visit your repository understand who you are and what your repository is about. 

Please be sure that your markdown is properly formatted. See this [markdown reference](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) from GitHub if you need help getting started. 

In your README.md file, when applicable, write about: 

- Your name, your program, and your research project. 
- Links to your other profile (Twitter, LinkedIn, personal website, other relevant links, etc)
- What do you hope to achieve in this course
- What this repository is for (example: " This repository will contain my work in STAT540, which is a very awesome class with cool TAs.")
- Anything else that you want. You can try [emojicon](http://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/), too! 

You can start creating folders (eg. "paper_review", "assignment", "seminars") for your course work and put README.md files in them if you wish. 


## 2. Data insepction with R (2pt)

If you have never done R, you can check out this blog post on [getting started with R](http://santina.me/r/2015/12/15/Get-started-with-R.html) written by one of your TAs. Set aside an afternoon or an evening to just play around with R. 

When answering the following questions, please always "sandwich" your R code with some text. Ensure fluency by avoiding inserting R code or outputs without any explaination. For example, if the question ask you what x + y given x=1 and y=2, you can answer it like this: 

----

Now we want to find the sum of x and y.

```{r example_R}
x <- 1  # Note how I assign them to variables so it's clear that what I'm doing, instead of just priting 1+2
y <- 2 
sum <- x + y
sum # By doing this, I can print out the output of sum. Alternately, you can also do (sum <- x+y). 
```

Conclusion: we found that the sum is `r sum`. <---- (and here I'm using inline R code)

If you go to the .Rmd of this file (the Rmarkdown that creates this markdown you're looking at), and click on "Raw", you'll see that I have used inline R code to refer to the variable "sum" instead of directly typing "3". This is because if we ever need to change the values of x and y, we could possibly forget to update "3" as well. You can imagine that if you have to change the initial inputs of a long statistical reports, all your numbers in the rest of the report will change. You don't want to have to look through every sentence to make sure that your report is still up-to-date. 

By using variables and inline R code, I can change the value of x and/or y, and rest assure that when I re-knit my Rmarkdown, my conclusion statement will be updated. 

There are some [data sets](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html) in base R for you to play around with. We will explore the Titanic dataset. You can view it by typing `Titanic`. Just like with functions, you can use the question mark `?Titanic` to see more informaton about the dataset. 

Answer the following questions by subseting, printing out the result or by graphing. 

### 2.1 Passenger breakdown 

Convert the array into a data frame by using `data.frame()` function. 

- How many children and adults were on Titanic? 
- Were there more female adult or male adult passengers? 

### 2.2 Survival 

Using the same data frame, examine the survival rates.

- Did the children have better survival rate than the adults? 
- Which class of passengers have a better survival rate? (Crew, first class, second class, third class)

## 3. Data visualization (1.5pt)

Here you'll practice reading data from a text file and do some graphing. The file ["guinea_pig_tooth_growth.txt"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT540-UBC/STAT540-UBC.github.io/master/homework/practice_assignment/guinea_pigs_tooth_growth.txt) is actually the same data as the dataset `ToothGrowth`. You can use `?ToothGrowth` to see what it's about. However, use `read.table` to read this file into a data frame for this question. 

- Create a figure for this dataset (choose whatever graph you'd like!)
- Explain how your graph is informative: what does it tell you about the result of the experiment? Also explain why you choose to present the data in this way. 

## 4. Mechanics (0.5pt)

This point is for the "quality" of this assignment.  Check out [assignment tips](http://stat540-ubc.github.io/subpages/assignment_tips.html) if you're not sure what that means. Basically, it's important to write up organized reports that are clear and easy to follow, so that your collaborators and the future you can understand what you are doing. The elements that make up a good report include (not limited to): 

- Properly labeled graphs
- Well-formatted markdown (use of headings, subheadings, and numbering that makes sense)
- No inexplicable R outputs (example: printing out an entire dataframe unnecessarily when one can simply use `str()`) 
- Codes are commented when needed
- No broken code. 

We will also evaluate this part by looking at :

- Rmarkdown is properly knitted: markdown is created and easy to read on GitHub, figure folder is there, etc. 
- all the files associated with this assignment is put inside a named folder. 

Submit your assignment by opening an issue in your individual repo, tag the TAs and pasted the link to your latest commit.
